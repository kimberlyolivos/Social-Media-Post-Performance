# Insights deep dive

## Content categories and format performance
Over 2024 and the beginning of 2025 (from January 1st until May 1st) the content categories that have driven the **highest level of engagement** are **educational and product promotion**, reaching a total of around 40 million engagements. 

Although **Customer Story** content didn’t reach a high total engagement, possibly due to the limited number of posts made, it does have the **highest average engagement rate** (between 20 and 21%) among all categories for both years. Educational content also is the second content category with one of the highest average engagement rate. On the other hand, the average engagement rate for product promotion content is one of the lowest, at 12%.

An important fact to highlight is the **user preference for organic content**. Since early last year, this type of content has consistently driven the highest engagement across categories.

In regards to content format, during 2024, videos and live streams showed a **similar average engagement rate across the categories of Customer Story** (19–20%), Educational (20%), and Product Promotion (11–12%). In 2025, this similarity has maintained for **Customer Story and Product Promotion**, but for Educational content, **videos have shown a 2% increase in their average engagement rate**.

Across the three categories, videos were posted more often than live streams. However, in 2024, live streams performed better in terms of CTR for both Customer Story and Educational content, with an average of 1.75%, and they usually got more likes, shares, comments, and views. 

In early **2025**, 
-	**Customer Story** live streams still have a higher CTR than videos.
-	For **Educational content**, live streams are ahead in CTR, but videos bring in more interactions overall.
-	In **Product Promotion**, videos clearly lead in average CTR for both 2024 and 2025

## Hashtags that reach higher level of impressions
Since the beginning of 2024, the hashtags that have constantly driven the highest reach are:
-	**#CustomerStory** for Educational and Customer Story content
-	**#ProductDemo** for Product Promotion
-	**#TrendingNow** for Entertainment
-	**#EventRecap** for the Event/Webinar category

## Recommendations
Some recommendations that would be introduced to the marketing team are the following:
-	Increase the production of Customer Story content in video format in 2025, since they have the highest engagement rate as well as a high average CTR.
-	Implement strategies to re-engage the U.S. audience by adjusting posting schedules and content formats to align with their current content preferences and behavior patterns.
